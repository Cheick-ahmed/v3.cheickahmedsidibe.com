Have you ever visited a website and been completely in awe of the elegance and simplicity of its design? For me, that website is Stripe. Stripe is a company that allows people and businesses to accept payments online and in mobile apps.

Rather than making design an afterthought, it's treated as a first-class citizen at Stripe. You can almost feel the hours of work spent iterating over designs and making minor tweaks when viewing the website's pages. In this article, I'm going to break down how Stripe creates these beautiful designs and give some tips and tricks to web designers and developers alike.
